# Sources section defines all source directories and their settings.
# By default a regular site needs only one style and script file,
# but more complicated sites could benefit of multiple sources.
# For example if you have an admin panel and you want to separate the
# styles and scripts from the front part of the website this is a perfect
# case for multiple sources.
